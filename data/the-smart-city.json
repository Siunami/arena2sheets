All of which improves the overall quality of life in your city.</p>","visibility":"public","content":"","description":"While driving in to the city for date night, a woman checks her smartphone for available parking and directs her husband to a spot right in front of their favorite restaurant. Across town, a man leaving work checks traffic feeds to plan his fastest route home. Meanwhile, a city worker checks garbage can sensors to see which bins are full and require pickup. \n\nToday, people have high expectations for where they live. They want immediate access to the city services they need. They want it to be easier to live greener. They want to use their favorite technology to help them live smarter. Now they can, with Cisco® technology. \n\nCisco Digital Network Architecture for Cities (Figure 1) is a foundational infrastructure of the Internet of Everything (IoE) for cities, the networked connection of people, process, data, and things. By connecting services to a shared and intelligent infrastructure, you can solve your city’s most critical problems, such as parking, traffic management, lighting, water, and waste management. Air, noise, and water-quality sensors provide insights to help agencies make better sustainability plans. At the same time, you can provide citizens with Internet connectivity and access to real-time information about services, such as traffic and parking. All of which improves the overall quality of life in your city.\n","source":null,"image":{"filename":"572869dfecdd6fe89f9b4f35c14b74f5.jpg","content_type":"image/jpeg","updated_at":"2017-04-03T01:01:33.452Z","thumb":{"url":"https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/957712/thumb_572869dfecdd6fe89f9b4f35c14b74f5.jpg?1491181293"},"square":{"url":"https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/957712/square_572869dfecdd6fe89f9b4f35c14b74f5.jpg?1491181293"},"display":{"url":"https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/957712/display_572869dfecdd6fe89f9b4f35c14b74f5.jpg?1491181293"},"large":{"url":"https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/957712/large_572869dfecdd6fe89f9b4f35c14b74f5.jpg?1491181293"},"original":{"url":"https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/957712/original_572869dfecdd6fe89f9b4f35c14b74f5.jpg?1491181293","file_size":102397,"file_size_display":"100 KB"}},"embed":null,"attachment":null,"metadata":null,"base_class":"Block","class":"Image","user":{"id":4840,"created_at":"2014-05-22T12:38:28.492Z","slug":"christina-badal","username":"Christina Badal","first_name":"Christina","last_name":"Badal","full_name":"Christina Badal","avatar":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/4840/small_664a9f3ba4a7fe0b84b2be5f161b8567.gif?1454175708","avatar_image":{"thumb":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/4840/small_664a9f3ba4a7fe0b84b2be5f161b8567.gif?1454175708","display":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/4840/medium_664a9f3ba4a7fe0b84b2be5f161b8567.gif?1454175708"},"channel_count":328,"following_count":229,"profile_id":20197,"follower_count":383,"initials":"CB","can_index":true,"metadata":{"description":""},"is_premium":true,"is_exceeding_private_connections_limit":false,"is_confirmed":true,"is_pending_reconfirmation":false,"is_pending_confirmation":false,"badge":"investor","base_class":"User","class":"User"},"position":12,"selected":false,"connection_id":1128261,"connected_at":"2017-04-03T01:01:33.153Z","connected_by_user_id":4840,"connected_by_username":"Christina Badal","connected_by_user_slug":"christina-badal"},{"id":957715,"title":"Cisco Smart+Connected Safety and Security Solution Components and Primary Features","updated_at":"2017-05-08T14:21:24.356Z","created_at":"2017-04-03T01:05:46.082Z","state":"available","comment_count":0,"generated_title":"Cisco Smart+Connected Safety and Security Solution Components and Primary Features","content_html":"","description_html":"<p>The city command center receives an alert about a blacklisted car that was captured by the automated license plate recognition feature on a traffic camera near the city center.

This second-order cybernetics highlighted the non-linear character of systemic change and the question of emergent properties. Where the ‘old’ cybernetics observed probabilistic interaction within closed systems of human–machine interaction, the new cybernetics argued that there is no outside to these systems, that the observer is always included in them, that systems are their own environment and that their evolutionary trajectories are inherently open and unpredictable. As von Foerster put it in 1972, ‘observations are … relative to the observer’s point of view … [and] affect the observed so as to obliterate the observer’s hope of prediction’ (cited in Wolfe, 1995: 49).","description":"","source":null,"image":null,"embed":null,"attachment":null,"metadata":null,"base_class":"Block","class":"Text","user":{"id":4840,"created_at":"2014-05-22T12:38:28.492Z","slug":"christina-badal","username":"Christina Badal","first_name":"Christina","last_name":"Badal","full_name":"Christina Badal","avatar":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/4840/small_664a9f3ba4a7fe0b84b2be5f161b8567.gif?1454175708","avatar_image":{"thumb":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/4840/small_664a9f3ba4a7fe0b84b2be5f161b8567.gif?1454175708","display":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/4840/medium_664a9f3ba4a7fe0b84b2be5f161b8567.gif?1454175708"},"channel_count":328,"following_count":229,"profile_id":20197,"follower_count":383,"initials":"CB","can_index":true,"metadata":{"description":""},"is_premium":true,"is_exceeding_private_connections_limit":false,"is_confirmed":true,"is_pending_reconfirmation":false,"is_pending_confirmation":false,"badge":"investor","base_class":"User","class":"User"},"position":62,"selected":false,"connection_id":1368221,"connected_at":"2017-07-25T20:32:26.377Z","connected_by_user_id":4840,"connected_by_username":"Christina Badal","connected_by_user_slug":"christina-badal"},{"id":1150538,"title":"","updated_at":"2017-07-25T20:38:04.656Z","created_at":"2017-07-25T20:38:04.358Z","state":"available","comment_count":0,"generated_title":"Untitled","content_html":"<p>David Chandler (2014) contends that resilience – and, it could be added, non-equilibrial thinking as such – became the new art of governing complexity, where ‘the unknowability of complex life itself comes to constitute the rationality of its governance’ and policy failure is … ‘not a failure of policy’ but a learning opportunity with regard to the systemic process of unintended consequences and side-effects in a complex world, where failure enables policy-makers to learn from the revelation of these concrete and emergent interconnections.

Critics who see in cybernetic control a homogenising force are therefore wrong: it does away with history, not difference. Cybernetic control perpetuates a difference without history: ‘feedback knows no outside or contradiction, only perpetual iteration’ (Pinto, 2014: 73).
